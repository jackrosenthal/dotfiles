Slowly moving my configs from Dropbox to here ...

Use what you want. I make no guarantees that these configs will work
for anyone else but me.

All files are MIT licensed, except the desktop background, which Apple
Computer probably has some sort of copyright on (it came with Mac OS 8).
You probably don't care about this anyway, as most people tell me that
my desktop background looks terrible. Some have even confused it for
screen artifacts.
